# Getting Started with Create React App

Key가 없다면?
Warning : Each child in a list should have a unique "key".
리액트는 어떤 DOM요소에 .map을 실행해야 하는지 모른다.
key로는 array를 unique하게 구별할 수 있는 것을 사용한다. 주로, id를 사용한다(Backend에서 넘어오는 정보는 주로 id를 포함하고 있기 때문에)
array의 index를 사용하는 것은 지양해야하나, 다른 정보로 key로 사용할 게 없는 경우엔, index를 사용한다.

뒤에 추가한다면, 순서가 보장되었기 때문에 상관 없지만,
만약 앞에 추가하게 된다면 index가 변하게 된다. -> 순서가 일정하지 않기 때문에, 각자의 unique한 값을 key로 사용해야 제대로 작동하게 된다.
따라서 되도록이면 index가 아닌, id와 같이 고유한 값을 사용하는 것이 권장된다.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
